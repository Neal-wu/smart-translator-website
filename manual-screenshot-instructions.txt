ALTERNATIVE: USE ANY TRANSLATOR APP SCREENSHOT
---------------------------------------------
If you can't generate the screenshot, you can:
1. Take a screenshot of any translator app on your iPad
2. Crop it to 2048x2732 pixels
3. Use that as a placeholder for now
4. You can always update it later

The most important thing is to get the app submitted for review!
